Hangman Client States
------- ------ ------

Client states:

STATE_UNCONNECTED	not connected to server (initial and final states)
STATE_CONNECTED		connected to server, not playing a game
STATE_PLAYING		playing a game
STATE_WINNER		just won a game
STATE_LOSER		just lost a game


Client requests to server:

NEW	state must be STATE_CONNECTED
	starts a new game
	state becomes STATE_PLAYING

GUESS x state must be STATE_PLAYING
	guesses the letter "x"
	if the word has been guessed, the state becomes STATE_WINNER
	if the client has used all its guesses, the state becomes STATE_LOSER
	otherwise, the state remains STATE_PLAYING

QUIT	state must be STATE_WINNER or STATE_LOSER
	client state becomes STATE_CONNECTED

BYE	state must be STATE_CONNECTED
	state becomes STATE_UNCONNECTED

NB: This design doesn't allow a player to quit early.
