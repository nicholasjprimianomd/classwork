Hangman Protocol
------- --------

Server responses to client requests are newline-terminated byte streams.

When a client first contacts the server, the server sends an
identifying header line, such as

  Hangman Server (10 March 2004). Type "HELP" for help.

The server responds to client requests as follows:

HELP    server sends a help message

NEW	server responds by sending the byte stream representation of an int:
  	  the number of letters in the word

GUESS x guesses the letter "x"
	server responds with a stream (one per character in the word)
 	  of (the byte string representation of) booleans, with the Ith 
          being true or false, according as whether or not the letter
          guessed matches the Ith character of the word

QUIT	quits the game (for this particular word)
	server responds with a byte stream, which is the word for the game

BYE	disconnects from the server
	server does not send a response
